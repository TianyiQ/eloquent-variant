## About

Eloquent Variant is a theme derived from Eloquent, changes including:

- Adding an optional functionality of numbering sections, e.g. "Recap" `->` "1.2.3 Recap".
  - The basic implemention is based on [Vintage](https://github.com/tristone13th/typora-vintage-theme) - another Typora theme.
  - In addition, unused section levels can be automatically skipped; but it's supported only in HTML export.
- Changing the styles of quotation and TOC, to make them more visible.
- Changing the style of headings; Removing the fonts Lato and sans-serif.
- Enlarging the viewport size.
